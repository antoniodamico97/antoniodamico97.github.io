        “A real translation is transparent; it does not cover the original, does not block its light, 
        but allows the pure language, as though reinforced by its own medium, to shine upon the original all the more fully”</p>

            <p class="prose">What belongs to the canon of Italian literature and cinema? My project aims to approach these questions by examining the 2020  <a href="https://italian.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/GraduateReadingList2020.pdf">Graduate Reading List</a> of Italian Studies at Yale University and offer a quantitative analysis of some of the shared recurring features of the roughly 100 texts that have been selected in this list. To this end, my goal is to build a model that classifies whether a text is or is not likely to enter the canon according to a set of specific parameters. These include the gender of the author, their geographic (regional) provenance (using GeoPandas, if time permits), their age (how old was the author when their canonical text was released to the public), and the critical engagement with the text over the past century. Which generation of authors is more present than others? Which region is neglected? Overall, the project will reach a working positive (descriptive) definition of what is Italian culture as it is currently understood in 2022 at .

        <h2>Poems</h2>
        <p>The list lists the primary texts that the Italian Studies department at Yale has included in the graduate reading list. The list includes a total of 173 items and comprises:

        <ul>
          <li>17 Latin and Biblical texts</li>
          <li>50 stand-alone poems</li>
          <li>69 primary texts (including collections of poems and letters)</li>
          <li>27 texts on literary theory and history</li>
          <li>7 films</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

          <p class="prose">These texts have been transcribed into a csv file according to 8 parameters: name, title, year,
          age, birth, place, gender, genre. These will be used to answer the following question: what
          belongs to the canon of Italian literature and cinema? Let’s start by looking at an example:
          Alessandro Manzoni’s historical novel I Promessi Sposi (1840-2).</p>
